All of a sudden GPUs weren't just a way to make computers faster and more efficient. They're becoming the engines of a whole new way of computing. And this was a big big deal because before Alex Net, AI was considered to be only theoretical. It was slow, clunky, and disappointing. But AlexNet proved three very important things to the world. Number one, they proved that AI can learn if you give it enough data. Secondly, they proved that GPUs are the perfect brain to train these models. And last and most importantly, they proved that CUDA was the secret source that made it possible. And suddenly the entire world realized what Jensen had seen 6 years earlier. This was the spark that lit the AI revolution in the world. Because after Alex Net, Google built better search and translation, Facebook improved face recognition, Tesla started" , "hard")
